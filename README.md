# Senvaris: Driving Behavior Monitoring System ðŸš—

Senvaris is a Python-based system that detects risky driving behaviors 
(harsh braking, rapid acceleration, sharp turns, overspeeding) 
using simulated driving data.

## Features
- Real-time detection of unsafe driving patterns
- Anomaly detection with thresholds
- Logging system for driver behavior
- Ready to extend with Flask API for real-time alerts

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
